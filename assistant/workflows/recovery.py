"""
P.E.P.P.E.R. - Workflow Recovery

Phase 11C

Purpose:
Repair interrupted workflow runs after process or machine restart.

Safety rule:
A stale step marked "running" is never assumed successful.
It is reset to pending so the workflow resumes from the last verified
checkpoint.

Approval-paused runs remain approval-paused.
Completed/failed/cancelled runs are not modified.
