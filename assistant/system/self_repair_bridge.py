"""
P.E.P.P.E.R. - Health to Self-Engineering Bridge

Phase 15J

Purpose:
    Converts health/diagnostic evidence plus architecture ownership metadata
    into a bounded, approval-aware repair request for P.E.P.P.E.R.'s existing
    self-engineering/coding system.

Important:
    This module does not assume a specific coding-agent implementation.
    Instead, it accepts an executor callback supplied by the existing
    self-engineering architecture.

Safety:
    - unknown components fail closed
    - repair paths are bounded by Phase 15I ownership metadata
    - high-risk repairs require explicit approval
    - no source code is modified without an executor being provided
    - required regression tests travel with the repair request
