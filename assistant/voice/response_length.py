"""
P.E.P.P.E.R. - Voice Response Length Discipline

Final Phase 14/15 polish.

Purpose:
    Keep voice answers concise by default without losing information that
    changes the user's decision, action, safety, approval, diagnosis, or result.

Important:
    This policy changes GENERATION behavior, not merely TTS truncation.
    The model is asked to produce the right amount of information up front.

Modes:
    concise
        Normal voice conversation. Fast and complete.

    important
        Errors, diagnostics, health, security, approvals, failures, or other
        information where omission could materially mislead the user.

    detailed
        The user explicitly requests a deep/full/exhaustive explanation.

"Exactly" by itself is NOT treated as a request for an exhaustive answer.
