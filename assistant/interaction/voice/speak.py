"""
P.E.P.P.E.R. - Voice Synthesis Module

Phase 14 Rolling Speech Update
Phase 16E Low-Latency First Chunk

Behavior:
    The first speech chunk is synthesized immediately.
    As soon as playback of that chunk begins, the synthesis worker can prepare
    the following chunk. This repeats until the complete response has played.

Phase 16E:
    The first rolling speech chunk is reduced to one sentence. Later chunks
    remain paired. This improves time-to-first-audio without discarding any
    response content.

The resident LuxTTS worker remains protected by one process-wide TTS lock.
