"""
P.E.P.P.E.R. - Contextual Live Voice Commands

Phase 14J

Purpose:
    Classifies short conversational control utterances separately from
    application/session commands and normal prompts.

Important:
    "Actually ..." is treated as a revision/new authoritative turn.
    "Go back" is handled by the voice session using safe conversational
    history semantics; it does not blindly re-execute an old action.
