P.E.P.P.E.R. - Last Utterance Audio State

Phase 14 Voice Authentication

Purpose:
    Stores a thread-safe copy of the most recently finalized microphone
    utterance so wake-word authentication can verify the SAME audio that
    produced the transcript.

This module is intentionally Phase-14-only and does not alter frozen
Phase 1-13 request routing.
