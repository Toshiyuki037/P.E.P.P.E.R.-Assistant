"""
P.E.P.P.E.R. - Vision Lifecycle Manager

Created: August 9, 2026
Last Edited: August 9, 2026
Author: Max Maehara

Purpose:
    Manages temporary screenshots created by P.E.P.P.E.R.'s vision system.

How It Works:
    - Only files inside runtime/vision may be automatically deleted.
    - Normal vision screenshots are deleted after the reasoning request.
    - Stale orphaned screenshots are removed after crashes or forced exits.
    - Persistent visual memory, if added later, should use a different folder.

Most Recent Change:
    Added safe temporary screenshot deletion and stale-artifact cleanup.
