"""
P.E.P.P.E.R. - Controlled File Editing

Phase 12J

Purpose:
Apply explicit file replacements inside the planned transaction scope.

This module does not decide what code to write. It only enforces:
- repository-root confinement
- transaction path allowlist
- baseline transaction existence
- controlled UTF-8 writes
