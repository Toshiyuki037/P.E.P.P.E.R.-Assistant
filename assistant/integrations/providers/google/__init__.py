Purpose:
    Package entry point for P.E.P.P.E.R.'s Phase 9 Google integrations.

Architecture:

    Phase 9 integration registry can load Google's capabilities without
    depending on individual implementation modules.

Capabilities:
    - Google OAuth / identity
    - Gmail search/read when Gmail is available
    - Google Calendar read when Calendar is available
    - Google Contacts / People search
