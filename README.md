# E.V.I.E.

**E.V.I.E. — Enhanced Virtual Intelligence Engine** is a locally operated AI assistant designed as an engineering tool for persistent reasoning, memory, computer control, automation, and technical workflows.

E.V.I.E. is not designed as a novelty chatbot or simple voice assistant. Its foundation is a modular software architecture that separates reasoning, memory, tools, permissions, execution, verification, and voice interaction so the system can safely expand into more capable models, remote servers, and dedicated hardware without rebuilding the core.

> **Version:** 1.0  
> **Status:** Core Architecture Complete  
> **Development:** Phases 1–14

## What E.V.I.E. Is

E.V.I.E. is a persistent personal intelligence system built to sit between the user, AI models, local computers, external services, and future hardware.

Instead of allowing an LLM to directly control the computer, E.V.I.E. uses a layered architecture:

```text
User
 ↓
Voice / Terminal / Device Interface
 ↓
Context + Memory
 ↓
Reasoning / Planning
 ↓
Tool or Agent Routing
 ↓
Permission & Safety Layer
 ↓
Execution
 ↓
Verification
 ↓
Response

This separation is critical.

The language model can decide what should happen, but deterministic software controls whether it is allowed to happen and how it is executed.

That makes E.V.I.E. suitable for real engineering workflows rather than uncontrolled prompt-driven automation.

Core Capabilities
Voice & Conversation

E.V.I.E. includes a persistent voice runtime with:

Streaming speech recognition
Voice activity detection
Partial transcription
Final transcript reconciliation
English-focused Faster-Whisper STT
Local F5-TTS voice synthesis
Custom E.V.I.E. voice
Streaming / incremental spoken responses
Wake-word activation
Sleep / standby state
Session timeout
Cached low-latency acknowledgement lines
Voice identity verification
Contextual voice-session state

Example:

User:
"Pepper, good morning. What's on my calendar?"

E.V.I.E.:
"Authenticated. Welcome back, Max."

→ retrieves live data
→ answers by voice
→ remains available for follow-up conversation
Persistent Memory

E.V.I.E. maintains long-term semantic memory instead of treating each prompt as an isolated interaction.

The memory architecture supports:

Persistent user preferences
Project knowledge
Conversation history
Semantic retrieval
Embedding search
Reranking
Memory importance
Confidence
Permanence
Memory updates
Supersession
Forgetting
Duplicate detection
Intentional memory formation

Example:

"Use Honolulu as my default weather location going forward."

can become a persistent memory that future requests automatically use.

Tool Architecture

E.V.I.E. does not give unrestricted computer access to the LLM.

Real actions are performed through registered tools with defined capabilities, arguments, permissions, and risk levels.

The tool layer supports areas such as:

Files
Git
Terminal commands
Browser control
Applications
Windows control
External APIs
Connected accounts
Research
Weather
Productivity services
Financial information

Simple actions are handled through the single-action tool layer.

Multi-Step Agent Execution

More complex requests are routed to an agent system.

Example:

"Open YouTube in Chrome and maximize it."

can become:

1. Launch Chrome
2. Open YouTube
3. Change the window state
4. Verify the result

The agent architecture supports:

Goal decomposition
Multi-step execution
Persistent task state
Retry logic
Replanning
Verification
Approval checkpoints
Failure handling
Resume / cancel behavior

Unfinished tasks are isolated so they do not hijack unrelated future requests.

Computer Control

E.V.I.E. can interact with the local Windows environment through structured control methods.

Capabilities include:

Application launching
Window control
Browser interaction
Keyboard actions
File operations
Workspace awareness
Git operations
Terminal execution
Visual fallback
Result verification

The architecture prefers deterministic interfaces first and uses vision only when necessary.

Conceptually:

Native / Structured APIs
        ↓
Application Interfaces
        ↓
Browser DOM
        ↓
Accessibility / UI Control
        ↓
Vision Fallback
Vision & Computer Awareness

E.V.I.E. can use current computer context and screenshots when structured interfaces are insufficient.

This enables:

Active-window awareness
Screen understanding
Visual verification
UI-state recognition
Error/dialog inspection
Computer-control fallback

Vision is not the primary control mechanism; it supports the deterministic control stack.

Connected Services

E.V.I.E. includes a reusable integration architecture for external services.

Current integrations include or support:

Google services
GitHub
Notion
Spotify
Weather
Schwab read-only financial data
Apple bridge services

Future integrations can be added without redesigning the reasoning system.

Potential upcoming integrations include:

Canvas courses
Assignments
Grades
Due dates
Academic planning
Security & Authorization

E.V.I.E.'s architecture separates intelligence from authority.

Security can combine:

Voice identity
+
Trusted device
+
Session state
+
Tool permissions
+
Risk classification
+
Explicit approval

Examples:

Read-only information can often execute automatically.
Medium-risk actions can require approval.
Destructive or sensitive actions require stronger confirmation.
Voice authentication alone never authorizes dangerous operations.

This allows increasingly capable AI models to be added without giving those models unrestricted control.

Engineering & Project Intelligence

E.V.I.E. is designed heavily around technical work.

It can support workflows involving:

Software projects
Git repositories
Codebases
Engineering research
Local files
Testing
Debugging
Documentation
Research notes
Development environments
Project state

The goal is for E.V.I.E. to function as an engineering partner that understands not only a question, but the surrounding project and environment.

Telemetry & Reliability

E.V.I.E. measures internal system performance instead of treating latency as a black box.

Telemetry can track:

Tool routing
Agent execution
Memory processing
Reasoning
TTS generation
Playback
Time to first sentence
Total response time

The project also maintains a regression suite to prevent new features from silently breaking earlier phases.

Why the Architecture Matters

The most important part of E.V.I.E. V1 is not any single model or feature.

It is the foundation.

The system is intentionally model-agnostic. Future versions can replace or combine cloud models, local LLMs, coding models, vision models, and remote GPU inference without rebuilding memory, permissions, tools, voice, computer control, or integrations.

The long-term architecture is:

                     E.V.I.E.
                        │
                Intelligence Router
                        │
       ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
       │                │                │
    Local LLM       Cloud LLM       Specialist Models
       │                │                │
       └────────────────┼────────────────┘
                        │
              Core E.V.I.E. Runtime
                        │
     Memory / Tools / Agent / Security / Context
                        │
       ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
       │                │                │
    Desktop          Server          Remote Device

The model can change.

The machine can change.

The interface can change.

The underlying E.V.I.E. system remains the same.

Technology

Current stack includes:

Python 3.11
PyTorch
NVIDIA CUDA
Faster-Whisper
F5-TTS
FFmpeg
SoundDevice
SoundFile
Semantic embedding models
Reranking models
Playwright
REST APIs
Git
Windows system interfaces
Version 1

E.V.I.E. V1 establishes the complete assistant foundation.

At a high level, E.V.I.E. can now:

Hear
 ↓
Understand
 ↓
Remember
 ↓
Reason
 ↓
Plan
 ↓
Authorize
 ↓
Act
 ↓
Verify
 ↓
Respond

That foundation is now stable enough for development to shift away from building the basic assistant and toward increasing intelligence, speed, autonomy, deployment scale, and hardware integration.

Status
E.V.I.E. V1.0 — Core Foundation Complete

Phases 1–14 establish the base architecture required for a persistent engineering-focused personal AI system.

Future development builds on this foundation rather than replacing it.


This version makes the important point much clearer: **V1 is valuable because you built the operating architecture around the intelligence, not because you connected a microphone to an LLM.** The model is only one interchangeable component inside a memory-, tool-, permission-, agent-, and verification-driven engineering system.
